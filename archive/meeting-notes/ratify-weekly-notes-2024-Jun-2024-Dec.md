### Actionable Agenda Items:
- Release 1.3 Status

- [docs: Create proposal for annotation-based filtering](https://github.com/ratify-project/ratify/pull/1797)
    - key points: The exact mechanism for requiring the filtration should be specific to each verifier as the behavior and logic differs based on is actually being attested, as such, it will be part of the verifier configuration.
    - [Sajay] we might want to consider a max age filter

- **Info**: The [Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)](https://developercertificate.org/) on Pull Requests is enabled for every repo. It requires all commit messages to contain the `Signed-off-by` line with an email address that matches the commit author. [DCO](https://github.com/organizations/ratify-project/settings/installations/55020846) is a part of the [CNCF onboarding list](https://github.com/ratify-project/ratify/issues/1334#issuecomment-2316509398).

    - Andy/Sushant will follow up on comments and work on implementation PR
    - General comments:
        - Switch to a string based value to allow for extensible mutation behavior
        - Image references of the form `<repo>:<tag>@sha256:` will not perform extra tag to digest resolution based on tag. This may lead to digest provided in reference not corresponding to the provided tag; however, Ratify considers digest as source of truth and not tag so digest will have precedence.
        - Feature flags are not necessary and original proposal to propogate mutation behavior via command flag in deployment will be used
